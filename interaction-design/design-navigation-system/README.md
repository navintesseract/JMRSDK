# Navigation System

App is a collection of pages, _navigation_ describes the act of moving between pages and within a page. It's the starting point of the user experience, and it's how users find the content and features they're interested in. It's very important, and it can be difficult to get right.

## Principles of good navigation <a href="#navigationsystem-principlesofgoodnavigation" id="navigationsystem-principlesofgoodnavigation"></a>

Let's start with the basic principles of good navigation design:

* **Consistency:** Meet user expectations.
* **Simplicity:** Don't do more than you need to.
* **Clarity:** Provide clear paths and options.

Now, let's take our design principles--consistency, simplicity, and clarity--and use them to come up with some general recommendations.

1. Think about your users. Trace out typical paths they might take through your app, and for each page, think about why the user is there and where they might want to go.
2. Avoid deep navigation hierarchies. If you go beyond three levels of navigation, you risk stranding your user in a deep hierarchy that they will have difficulty leaving.
