### Logo Guidelines

The app icon serves as the first point of contact between users and your application.\
It represents the brand, grabs attention, and conveys the essence of your product with our platform. Consistency and adherence to app icon branding guidelines are crucial for ensuring a memorable user experience.

*   The JioImmerse logo must be incorporated on the right bottom corner of the App icon used on Google Playstore.

    * JioImmerse logo should be visible evidently.
    * The app icon should have distinct visual elements and should not blend with the JioImmerse logo.


* Use the PNG file provided [**here** ](https://tinyurl.com/2k6krnmp)to be added to your app icon. \
  \
  **The image should be used just as it is provided and should not be tampered with, tweaked, or edited in any way.**

### Description Guidelines

\
The app description plays a crucial role in attracting potential users and convincing them to download and engage with your app. \
It is an opportunity to effectively communicate your app's value proposition and create a positive impression.\
To ensure consistency and coherence in your app's branding and JioImmerse, it is important to follow the app description branding guidelines outlined below.

* The description should begin with 1 line overview of the app including the phrase “only with JioImmerse”. Refer to the example below for illustration.\
  <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png" alt="" data-size="original">**App Name**: Gallery XR\
  **App description**: App for viewing photos and videos from your phone in VR that works only with JioImmerse.
* Further in the description also include the phrase “The visuals are crafted to deliver the best experience on JioDive.”

In addition to the above guidelines, please ensure that you follow the community and Google Playstore Guidelines.\


**Note:** Our Brand Guidelines are an evolving process that will be continually updated as we embark on this journey. Stay tuned for future updates. :smile:
