# Components of Tesseract Mixed Reality Design

Components are building blocks for creating a user interface for user to interact with.

**Visual representations of states**\
Each state should be visually similar and not drastically alter a component, but must have clear affordances that distinguish it from other states and the surrounding layout.

## Understanding the Layer System

**Primary Layer**: Is the Main Layer and uses Primary Color

**Secondary Layer**: Is the Second Layer and uses Secondary Color

**Text/Icon Layer**: Is the Third Layer and is used for Text or Icons

Below is the few example of the layer system:

* **Text Button** Toolkit uses two layerâ€™s : Primary Layer and Text Layer.

* **Toggle Button** uses Secondary Layer, Secondary Filler, Primary Layer and a Text Layer.
