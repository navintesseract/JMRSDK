# Image View

An image is a graphic representation of something (e.g. photo or illustration). The borders have been added to these examples to help visualize empty space in the image frame.

## Best practices

Avoid using dark-colored images, as they are not clearly visible in additive displays such as JioGlass.

### Layout

With no imageFit property set, the width and height props control the size of the frame. Depending on which of those props is used, the image may scale to fit the frame.
