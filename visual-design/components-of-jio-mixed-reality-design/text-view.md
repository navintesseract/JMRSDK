# Text View

Text View gives a name or title to a control or group of controls, including text fields, check boxes, combo boxes, radio buttons, and drop-down menus.

## Best Practices

### Layout

* Text View should be close to the control they're paired with.

### Content

* Text View should describe the purpose of the control.
* Use sentence-style capitalization (only capitalize the first word.)
* Be concise.
* Use nouns or short noun phrases.
* Don't use Text View as instructional text. For example, "Click to get started".
