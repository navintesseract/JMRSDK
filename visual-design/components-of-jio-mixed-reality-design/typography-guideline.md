# Typography

Text is a component for displaying text. You can use Text to standardize across your web app.

You can specify the **weight** to apply font styles (JioType) to Text.\
If you do not specify the **weight** by default, Text applies styling from specifying the **weight** value to Medium.

Text alignment controls how text aligns in the space when it appears.\
There are three types of alignments:

Left-aligned: when text is aligned to the left margin

Right-aligned: when text is aligned to the right margin

Centered: when text is aligned to the center of the area
