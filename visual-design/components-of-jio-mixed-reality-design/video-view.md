# Video View

Video view is a video player toolkit that allows users to stream video content and browse through video content in Tesseract Mixed Reality platforms. It allows users to have a consistent watching experience.

## Best practices

* All must be set to active so that users can listen or watch multimedia at their own pace. This also allows users to toggle closed captions and full-screen mode on video players.
* Closed captions must be provided for videos.

### Layout

#### Key properties

* **Loop** – Whether an audio or video clip automatically starts over as soon as it finishes playing.
* **Media** – An identifier for the clip that an audio or video control plays.
* **Controls** – Whether an audio or video player shows, for example, a play button and a volume slider, and a pen control shows, for example, icons for drawing, erasing, and clearing.

## Video View Design

### **Maximize View**

* The thick seek bar and volume bar allows for better usability when using pointing devices such as gaze or controller inputs.
* This features a vertical volume bar for interaction
